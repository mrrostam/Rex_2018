# Quadrotor Control System for Efficient Point-to-Point Movement
This project is part of the Research Experience Program and has been developed by me.

# Project Description
The objective of this project is to design an efficient control system for guiding a quadrotor from point A to point B with minimal energy consumption. The system also accounts for the influence of wind during the movement period, ensuring accurate forecasting and responsive adjustments.
